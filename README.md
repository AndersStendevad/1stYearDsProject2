ITU Search has started its own new Ad Network. The customers are businesses who want to advertise on
the search engine by having their links appear when a user queries the engine with specific combinations of
keywords. The system has a limitation: once it sells a query to a customer, it cannot sell it to another one.
So it cannot have two businesses sharing a query.

Management wants to increase revenue. One strategy they identified is query suggestion. Suppose you
have a customer willing to pay $1 per impression for queries A, B, and C. Suppose that another customer
who offers only $0.5 per impression, is interested in queries A, B, C, and D. Clearly query D must be similar
to A, B, and C, since it interests them. Under the current bidding, ITU Search would only earn $3.5 per
impression. Could we suggest query D to the first customer and bring the revenue to $4 per impression?
Your task is to tell ITU Search which queries to suggest to which client because similar
clients requested them.

To complete your task you will have to face various issues. If the data were perfect, you could simply
compare directly the queries requested by a customer with everybody else and find the most similar one.
However, clients bid on queries they care little about, just to get something if somebody outbids them.
Moreover, by having a fuzzier matching you could get more queries to suggest, while finding the most similar
customer to a target customer might not generate enough suggestions.

A way to face these issues is to calculate the customer-customer similarity using network analysis. The
customer-query structure is a bipartite network which you can project in a customer-customer similarity
map using various techniques, and you can filter out the weakest connections to find groups of customers
using network backboning and community discovery.

Here are some queries you should be able to answer:
# 1. 
Find the query that is used, in absolute count, the most in a community. Suggest it to the top 5
customers in that community, which have not used that query. Select them according to your own
criteria.
# 2. 
Find any customer who bid only on two queries. Find at least three queries to suggest to them, among
the ones which they didnâ€™t pick up.
# 3. 
Find the list of communities of non trivial size (with at least 60 queries) which is dominated by a single
query (which is used by more than half the customers).
